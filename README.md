There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)

There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)

- August 2019 data shows that NYC Citi Bikes had over 2 million trips and most riders were subscribers. 

- Peak hours were 5pm to 7pm for start of trip.

- Checkout Time for Users shows that the vast majority of bikes are checked out only for about 6 minutes, which correlates to the probable needs of subscribers who live in the city and use the bikes for local commuting and errands.

- Checkout times by Gender does not show much difference by gender for the length of time bikes are checked out, only by minutes for each and most were less than 30 minutes for all genders. 

- Trips by Weekday per Hour shows that the busiest times during the week are early mornings and evening, while being later morning and early afternoon on weekends.

- Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) did not show much difference by hours for males and females but unknown genders seem to bike more on weekend.

- Trips by Gender by Weekday shows male and female riders are comparable proportionally and are more likely to be subscribers with higher riding rates mid-week, while unknown gender riders seem more likely not to be subscribers with higher riding rates on weekends.

## Summary:

There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (5 pt)
